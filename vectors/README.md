# QERRA-v2 Ethical Vectors

Each .json file defines a real-world ethical scenario that the quantum-humanoid stack must respect.

Currently:
- v001_28k_reclamation.json – colonial land betrayal
- v004_amorgos_2025.json – island economic severance

More vectors coming (family, environment, climate justice, small islands vs G20).

All vectors enforce unbreakable human-good priority.
