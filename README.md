**Status:** Active research & development – November 2025

### Core Idea
Combine real quantum entanglement (W-states, GHZ, cluster states) with classical robotic reasoning to achieve:
- Super-dense quantum memory for robot state  
- Native quantum parallelism for path planning  
- Genuine multipartite entanglement as sensor fusion backbone

### Current Milestones
- 8-qubit W-state successfully executed on IBM QUBS (127-qubit Eagle)  
  → Proof: https://github.com/marunigno-ship-it/8qubit-wstate-qubs  
- Quantum state vector as robot “belief state” prototype  
- Qiskit + ROS2 bridge in development

### Next Targets
- 12–16 qubit entangled states on real hardware  
- Quantum circuit → motor command mapping  
- Real-time quantum error mitigation for robotic control

### Tech Stack
- Qiskit / Qiskit-IBM-Provider  
- Python 3.11+  
- ROS2 (planned)
