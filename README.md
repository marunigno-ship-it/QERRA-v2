# QAI PROJECT

QAI PROJECT IS A UNIQUE QUANTUM PROJECT FOR MORE ETHICAL, FASTER, CAPABLE HUMANOID ROBOTS. AIDED BY GROK! A BLEND OF ADVANCED AI WITH QUANTUM COMPUTING PRINCIPLES. THE REAL KICKER... QERRA HYBRID ALGORITHM BASES ON STRICT ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS. THIS TECH PROJECT REALY BRINGS THE FUTURE INTO THE PRESENT!

## Welcome to QAI Project
QAI Project is a groundbreaking initiative that fuses advanced AI with quantum computing principles to create more ethical, faster, and capable humanoid robots. At its core is the **QERRA** (Quantum-Ethical Resource Allocation) algorithm, designed to ensure bias-free decision-making in high-stakes scenarios like disaster rescues. Built self-taught with Grok/xAI guidance, this project emphasizes ethical core based on Asimov's laws, making robots that prioritize "no harm" while maximizing utility.

## Core Features
- **Quantum-AI Fusion**: Combines quantum superposition for option exploration with classical optimization for moral filtering.
- **Ethical Core**: Strict adherence to modified Asimov rules, with dynamic priority vectors for vulnerability (e.g., child=3, elderly=2).
- **NISQ-Ready**: Efficient for current hardware, short circuits, few qubits.
- **Scalable**: From simulations to real Optimus/Tesla integrations.

## Tech Stack
- Qiskit or QuTiP for quantum sim.
- SciPy/NumPy for optimization.
- Python 3.10+.

## Get Started
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/marunigno-ship-it/QAI-PROJECT-QERRA.git`
2. Install deps: `pip install qutip scipy numpy`
3. Run sim: `python src/qerra_sim.py` (outputs alloc like [3.0,0.0,0.0]/9.0 for child prio).

## Whitepaper & Prototypes
[QERRA Whitepaper]) ( https://gist.github.com/marunigno-ship-it/1c2cb425f07ff08de762b4033b5bdff8 ) - Quantum ethics, algo math, sim results.
- [QERRA Sim Code](src/qerra_sim.py) - Tested: Child/doc realloc (9.0/12.0 scores).

## Roadmap
- Phase 1: Simulations (in progress).
- Phase 2: IBM Quantum tests.
- Phase 3: Robot integration (Optimus/SpaceX).
